A personal blog project based on springboot,mybatis-plus and semanticUI.

This personal blog project is a reference to the video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nE411r7TF?from=search&seid=8227320953950160354

If you are not familiar with Mybatis-plus,then I suggest you use JPA from video as the persistence layer framework to reduce unnecessary trouble.
